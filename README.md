Bored of the constant custom builds or new blogging platform that pops up for a few years and then disappears. 

This is the start of a site built with just html and css with either zero or minimal use of a programming language (JS for example). The idea here is to build something that looks reasonable and will just work forever no matter what + that does not require crazy upgrades or updates every six months.
