        <h3>The latest 'thing'</h3>
      </div>

        <p>
          It's quite easy to get sucked into a space like vacuum on social
          media, particularly on X, in the Tech communities. This of course
          makes you more inclined to believe what is popular and regularly
          regurgitated, use X tech for this and B for that. With promises that
          the graciously chosen latest 'thing' solves all the problems you have
          experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thats not really 'fun'. Problem solving is (for me) why programming is
          a field I've dedicated a significant part of my life so far to doing
          day to day. Why doesn't that thing work? How in the world do we
          integrate with the archaic system that appears to make little to no
          sense? Why is the data different? What the hell does that function do?
          And of course WTF's per minute when you find something a few years on
          that now makes no sense even though it would've made sense at the time
          and you have ti rediscover that programmers context and thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coding should be fun. The limiting factor is definition of the problem
          and learning the knowledge you need to solve it and working with
          people who enjoy that journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest 'thing' is cool, could be fun and it might solve a problem.
          But lets stop the nonsense of force-feeding it to everyone like its
          the only correct solution, it never has been and never will be.
